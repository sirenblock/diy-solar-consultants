I notice there's an issue with the content you've provided. The "Content with links" section shows "[object Object]" which appears to be a JavaScript object reference rather than actual article content.

Since:
- No internal links were provided
- No external links were provided  
- The content appears to be corrupted or not properly formatted

I cannot perform the link verification or provide a corrected article. Could you please:

1. Provide the actual article content (not the object reference)
2. Clarify what internal and external links should be included

Once you provide the proper article content, I'll be happy to check for any missing or duplicate links and make the necessary corrections.
