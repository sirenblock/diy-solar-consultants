## 6. Pricing FAQs

**Common Pricing Questions:**

**Q: Why do prices vary by system size?**
A: Larger systems require more engineering time, more complex calculations, and more detailed documentation. Our base packages cover most residential systems up to 15kW. Larger systems may incur additional fees.

**Q: What if my project is more complex than expected?**
A: We'll let you know upfront during consultation. Complex projects (unusual roof, challenging site, unique requirements) may require additional engineering time. We always communicate additional costs before starting work.

**Q: Do you offer discounts for multiple systems?**
A: Yes! If you're installing solar on multiple properties (or helping friends/family), contact us for volume pricing.

**Q: Is the federal tax credit included in these prices?**
A: No. Our service fees qualify for the 30% federal tax credit, but that's a tax benefit you receive when filing taxes. Our prices are pre-tax-credit.

**Q: What's included in "permit revisions"?**
A: If your permit is rejected or corrections are requested by the building department, we revise the plans at no charge until approved. This is unlimited for AHJ-requested changes. If you want to change the design significantly after approval (different equipment, size change), that may incur revision fees.

**Q: Can I upgrade my package later?**
A: Yes! If you start with Design Only and later want permitting or equipment sourcing, we can upgrade your package and credit what you've already paid.

**Q: Do you charge by system size?**
A: Our base prices cover typical residential systems (up to 15kW). Very large residential (15-25kW) may add $100-$300. Commercial systems are custom quoted.

**Q: What if I only need part of a service?**
A: Contact us! We can sometimes customize services. For example, if you already have a design and just need permitting, or just need equipment sourcing.
