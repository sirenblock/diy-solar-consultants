### CASE STUDY 1: Residential Grid-Tied (Medium)

**Project Name:** "Austin Suburban Solar"

**Header Image:** Residential home with solar panels on roof

**Quick Stats:**
- **System Size:** 8.5kW
- **Location:** Austin, Texas
- **Type:** Grid-tied, String inverter with optimizers
- **Install Type:** DIY with electrician for final connection
- **Timeline:** 8 weeks (consultation to PTO)
- **Total Savings:** $12,800 (53% vs. professional installation)

**Client Background:**
"John M. is a retired electrician who wanted to reduce his electricity bills and gain energy independence. With experience in electrical work but none in solar, he sought professional design while planning to do the installation himself."

**Project Challenges:**
- Moderate shading from oak trees in backyard
- Two-plane roof (south and west-facing)
- Older 100-amp electrical panel
- HOA approval required

**Our Solution:**
- 8.5kW system split across two roof planes
- SolarEdge inverter with P370 optimizers to mitigate shading
- 22 panels: 16 on south roof, 6 on west roof
- Panel upgrade to 125-amp service included in design
- Professional HOA submission package with renderings

**System Details:**
- **Panels:** Canadian Solar HiKu7 390W (22 panels)
- **Inverter:** SolarEdge SE7600H-US with P370 optimizers
- **Mounting:** IronRidge XR100 rails on composition shingle
- **Annual Production:** 11,850 kWh (estimate)
- **Annual Savings:** $1,540 in electricity costs

**Cost Breakdown:**
- Equipment: $9,200
- Design + Permitting: $1,200
- Electrician (panel upgrade + interconnection): $800
- **Total DIY Cost:** $11,200
- **After 30% Tax Credit:** $7,840
- **Professional Quote:** $24,000
- **Savings:** $12,800 (53%)

**Installation Experience:**
"I installed the mounting and panels myself over two weekends. The design was incredibly detailed - every measurement, every wire size, every connection. Permit was approved on first submission. I hired an electrician for the panel upgrade and final AC connection. System has been producing exactly as projected for 18 months now. Best investment I've made."

**Results:**
- ✓ Permit approved first submission (3 weeks)
- ✓ Installation completed in 3 weekends
- ✓ Passed inspection on first attempt
- ✓ System producing 101% of estimates (18 months average)
- ✓ Electricity bill reduced from $185/mo to $22/mo
- ✓ Payback period: 5.1 years
- ✓ 25-year savings: $48,000+

**Lessons Learned:**
"Take your time with the mounting - it's the most critical part. The electrical is straightforward if you follow the design. Don't skip the optimizer installation - they really do help with shading."
