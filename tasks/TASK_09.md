## 7. Common Concerns Addressed

**"I'm not an electrician - can I really do this?"**
Many of our clients aren't electricians. Modern solar equipment (especially microinverters) is designed for easier installation. Plus, you can hire an electrician for final connections and still save 30-40%.

**"What if I make a mistake?"**
Our designs ensure you have the right plan. Most "mistakes" are easily corrected. We're here to support troubleshooting. Plus, inspections catch issues before system goes live.

**"I don't have time for a long project."**
Actual installation is typically 2-5 days of work (spread over weekends if needed). Most of the timeline is waiting (permits, equipment, utility) - not active work.

**"What if it doesn't work after I install it?"**
We help troubleshoot until your system is operational. Our designs are proven. If equipment is defective, warranties cover replacement.

**"I'm worried about damaging my roof."**
Proper flashing techniques prevent leaks. Many DIY'ers hire roofers just for mounting ($1,000-$2,500) and do the rest themselves. Still save substantially.
